Inside each folder, you'll find:

- `solution.txt` — the clean code solution (usually in JavaScript or another language I'm practicing)
- `explanation.docx` — a detailed explanation of the problem, my thought process, and the approach used

---

## 🧠 Goals

- Improve problem-solving and coding skills
- Build a consistent habit of practicing algorithms and data structures
- Create a personal reference for interview prep and revision
- Share clean, well-documented solutions with others

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- JavaScript (main language for solutions)
- Microsoft Word (`.docx` for explanations)
- Git & GitHub for version control and tracking

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Browse the folders by problem number/title
2. Open `solution.txt` to view the code
3. Open `explanation.docx` to read the breakdown and reasoning
